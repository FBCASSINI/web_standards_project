	  		<p class="topic">WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</p><br>
				<p>I've had some problems creating Naviagtion menus in the past. In this class I hope to learn how to properly code this navigation menu with dropdown.</p><br><br>
    		<p class="topic">HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</p><br>
    				<p>The Navigation menu is a more advanced HTML5 coding. In the past i never quite understood how to make one on my own. This class is suppose to be a challege and a way to understand 					semantics of HTML5 coding. I really believe this is a excellent component to try and grasp HTML5 semantics.</p><br><br>
   				 <p class="topic">HOW MIGHT I BUILD THIS?</p><br>
   				 <ol>
    				<li>Create the component as a <code>&#60;header&#62;</code>.</li>
   					 <li>Adding a Logo using <code>&#60;img&#62;</code> or <code>&#60;h1&#62;</code>.</li>
   					 <li>Navigation <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> using a <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> with 5 <code>&#60;li&#62;</code> with another <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;li&#62;</code> 		                          nested for the dropdown menu.</li>
   					 </ol>

    	<p class="topic">WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</p><br>
    	<p>I plan to learn to code in images the way that is shown in the example image. I really like how the images are structured in very unquie ways 	and am curious to know how its done. I think i may know how to but want to learn the correct way.</p><br><br>
    	<p class="topic">HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</p><br>
    	<p>This relates with WDD because i have seen this discussed in the last classes but not so advanced the way it is show in the example image.</p><br><br>
    <p class="topic">HOW MIGHT I BUILD THIS?</p><br>
    	
                    <ol>
   						 <li>I would start by adding a <code>&#60;section&#62;</code>to grasp the collection of images.</li>
   						 <li>Then I would make a <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> for each image</li>
   						 <li>3rd i was set the desire with for each image using the <code>&#60;img&#62;</code>
    					<li>4th i would use css to add a absolute to each div class with the desired cordinates on the page.
   					</ol>

<p>What i hope to learn is to learn to style like the way in the eample image. This image has a hoover effect that changed color. I would like to know more about the semantics with in this style of coding.</p><br><br>
<p class="topic">HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</p><br>
<p>This example relates to WDD because i have studied it in the past. Im still not quite sure how it would be coded but i think i may know how to code it.</p> <br><br>
<p class="topic">HOW MIGHT I BUILD THIS?</p><br>
					<ol>
						<li>First I would make a <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> with 3 <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>
						<li>From there i would unstylize the <code>&#60;ul&#62; and <code>&#60;li&#62;</code></code></li>
						<li>I would then make it <code>inline</code> through css</li>
						<li>Then add a <code>box model</code> through css and add the icons using the <code>&#60;img&#62;</code> tag</li>
						<li>Finally i'll add the <code>hoover</code> psuedo with the color red</li>
					</ol>

    <p>This example i really hope to learn because i have no idea how it would be built. I think is really cool it has a feature. I hope to learn how to build it semanticlly. So i can can carry on with my work in the future.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="topic">HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</p><br>
    <p>In my last javascript class we learned something like the example shown. I just never full understood how it can be implemented. I believe this component will be probably the hardest to do because i believe it has javascript to make the code function. I'm have a very blank idea how i would code it but i know it would be helpful to me tryy t=and tackle it.<br><br></p>

                         <ol>
    						<li>I would start by adding a <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> with in the section give it a <code>&#60;id&#62;</code></li>
    						<li>Then I would make a <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and a <code>&#60;li&#62;</code> for each <code>&#60;p&#62;</code>element</li>
   							 <li>3rd I will add some javascript to <code>&#60;main.js&#62;</code></li>
   							 <li>4th i would use the <code>&#60;.class&#62;</code>from the section and call the <code>&#60;main.js&#62;</code> code in in the file</li>   
   						 </ol>

				<p>I plan to learn from this example is how to add social network icons in the website footer. I still kind of rusty how this would be done but if i search how to do it i believe i can 			accomplish it. This also should be the easist of them all but i stll am not sure how it would be done properly and semanticlly.</p><br><br>
				<p class="topic">HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</p><br>
				<p>This realtes to WDD that i will learn because i have not learned this in the past i hope to master it soon.</p> <br><br>

                        <ol>
							<li>First I would make a <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> with 4 <code>&#60;li&#62;</code></li>
							<li>From there i would unstylize the <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>so know bullets will be seen</li>
							<li>I would then make it <code>inline</code> through css</li>
							<li>Then add a <code>box model</code> through css and add the socail network icons using the <code>&#60;img&#62;</code> tag</li>
							<li>Finally i'll add the <code>a</code> anchor to link to my social network sites.</li>
